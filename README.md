WebGIS Project for Geoparque Caminhos dos Cânions do Sul (GCCS)
Project Overview
This WebGIS project is dedicated to publishing detailed geomorphological, geological, and structural data for the territory of the Caminhos dos Cânions do Sul UNESCO Global Geopark (GCCS). The goal is to provide an accessible platform for visualizing and analyzing the unique geological features and processes that define this region.

Abstract
The taxonomic cartography of relief is a crucial tool for the characterization and interpretation of geological, climatic, and geomorphological processes that shape the Earth's surface through endogenous and exogenous forces. The territory of the Caminhos dos Cânions do Sul UNESCO Global Geopark (GCCS) holds significant geological attributes, including Permian and Jurassic sedimentation records, Cretaceous magmatism, and evidence of uplift, subsidence, and continental drift. These processes have influenced the formation of continental and transitional deposits from the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs.

The geoevolutionary context, coupled with recent climatic conditions, has led to the development of several geomorphological compartments that define the CCGS landscape. Notably, a continuous cliff separates the plateau from the plains. This study characterizes the first (morphosculpture) and second (morphostructure) taxonomic levels using bibliographic information and the integration of raster and vector data with geological, structural, hypsometric, and slope angle analyses within a GIS environment.

This project presents an updated and detailed cartography of relief units for the CCGS territory, characterizing two morphosculptures from the first taxonomic level (Bacia Geológica e Magmatismo Serra Geral and Planície Costeira) and six morphostructures from the second taxonomic level (Patamares da Serra Geral, Escarpas da Serra Geral, Planalto da Serra Geral, Planalto Dissecado Rio das Antas, Planície Continental, and Planície Litorânea). A new unit is proposed based on distinct morphometric characteristics of the Serra Geral Plateau.
